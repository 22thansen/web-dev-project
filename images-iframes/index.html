      I think I get why CSS was invented. Inline customization with html is pretty unreadable.
      Also it sucks to go to each line and change the inline style so i kinda winged how to do CSS.
      Unsure if doing it like this is the best practices, but whatever :P

        <p> Hello, my name is Tanner. I like to do stuff on the computer! I like to code, and my favorite programming language is <strong>C#</strong>, but I occasionally use other languages like <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>Javascript</strong> <em>(technically a modified version called p5.js, used for the HTML Canvas)</em>. I try to make video games with code, but I have a bad habit of never committing to a single project and finishing it. I also like to play the video game Minecraft; a few years ago I was actually part of a build-team where we would brainstorm on an idea and build it in-game. It was a lot of fun and I think it helped me become a better artist in general. Speaking of art, I also enjoy making a special type of art called pixel art. I'm still a beginner and I'm a little uncomfortable with animation, but it's been fun making little images with the restrictive-retro style. Similar to the retro-aspect of pixel art, I've made chiptune music in software trackers like FamiTracker or OpenMPT. They're nothing too crazy, but I enjoy the process of it even if it's a little tedious. Overall, I'm kind of a retro-guy in terms of art and music. I'm proud of what I've made in the past, and when I get some spare time away from school, I'd like create more stuff! </p>
